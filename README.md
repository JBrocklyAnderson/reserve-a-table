# The Little Lemon's Mobile Table Reservation System

## Introduction
The Little Lemon is a popular (fictitious) Italian restaurant that this application was made to benefit. The restaurant's owners reached out to me through Meta's Front-End Developer specialization in pursuit of an application that would let their guests make table reservations any time, any where. To tailor my solution to the specific needs of their patronage, I gathered everything I'd need to know about the restaurant, their customers, and the application itself.

## Objectives
- Engage in user research to craft an exemplary user persona that encapsulates an average patron with the restaurant
- Use this persona to create a journey of their experience through the existing app as well as through a new table reservation feature to anticipate customer needs and satisfy their expectations
- Develop a design system
