# The Little Lemon's Mobile Table Reservation System

## Introduction
The Little Lemon is a popular (fictitious) Italian restaurant that this application was made to benefit. The restaurant's owners reached out to me through Meta's Front-End Developer specialization in pursuit of an application that would let their guests make table reservations any time, any where. To tailor my solution to the specific needs of their patronage, I gathered everything I'd need to know about the restaurant, their customers, and the application itself.

## Business Objectives
- Engage in user research to craft an exemplary user persona that encapsulates an average patron with the restaurant
- Use this persona to create a journey map of their experience through the app's new table reservation feature to anticipate customer needs and satisfy their expectations
- Create an engaging, easy-to-use reservation form that gives customers the ultimate freedom to customize their reservation
- Logically validate user input in accordance to best practices in security and user experience
- Write stringent tests to ensure that user input has been received and that it has been properly validated and sanitized if necessary

#### Style Guide
- The codebase has been formatted according to a consistent style guide for readability, maintainability, and collaborative efficacy
- Import statements follow a consistent ordering (React hooks, external packages, internal scripts, stylesheets, dynamic assets, static assets).
- Import statements are seperated from each other by a single empty line and separated from functions—themselves seperated from the component block by two empty lines—above the component block by five empty lines.
- ES6 arrow functions are used wherever possible.
- Single quotes `''` wrap string data unless such data contains a semantic apostrophe, in which case it's wrapped with double quotes `""`.
- The use of ternary operators is treated as the default mechanism for establishing conditionality
- Comments written above a code block help explain the entire snippet while inline comments elaborate on the specific line of code they follow.
- Element attributes are given their own lines for readability.
